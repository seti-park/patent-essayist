## Problem

Mobile wall-of-text paragraphs recur in **2 of 2 essays** at `medium` severity (goal 3,
reader understanding), and are structurally invisible to the gate that exists to catch them:
`STRUCT-001` counts **sentences** (max 8), so a 4–6-sentence paragraph of long sentences
sails through while rendering as >8 mobile lines.

- Run 1, iter 1 (medium): three walls — 124w, 120w, 115w (words/12 > 8-line heuristic);
  the run-1 editor already recommended "a word-count warn heuristic (~>110w per paragraph)
  to gate_structure".
- Run 1, iter 2 (low): two carried marginals at the heuristic edge (107w, 99w).
- Run 2, iter 1 (medium): two walls — §1p2 129w, §2p3 136w; again gate-invisible, again
  cost revision work.
- Run 2, iter 2 (low): three retained 96w+ paragraphs needed explicit editorial
  adjudication (114w / 99w / 111w stands accepted with recorded reasons).

Record count 4 ≥ RECUR_THRESHOLD(3), cross-essay 2/2, mechanically checkable with zero
hard-fail risk (`gate_structure` is warn-only by design) → `recommended-apply`.

## Proposed change (exact diff)

**File 1: `.claude/skills/_shared/scripts/gate_structure.py`**

```diff
 GATE_ID = "structure"
 MAX_SENTENCES_PER_PARA = 8       # STRUCT-001 threshold
+MAX_WORDS_PER_PARA = 110         # STRUCT-005 threshold (~8 mobile lines; ed. heuristic words/12)
 MAX_BOLD_PER_100_WORDS = 2       # STRUCT-002 threshold (spans per 100 words)
```

and, immediately after the STRUCT-001 loop (`findings.append({... "STRUCT-001" ...})` block):

```diff
     # STRUCT-001: long paragraphs
     for start, text in paragraphs:
         n = _count_sentences(text)
         if n > MAX_SENTENCES_PER_PARA:
             findings.append({
                 "check_id": "STRUCT-001",
                 "severity": "warn",
                 "message": "paragraph has %d sentences (max %d)" % (n, MAX_SENTENCES_PER_PARA),
                 "location": "line %d" % start,
             })
+
+    # STRUCT-005: mobile wall-of-text by WORD count. Sentence counting (STRUCT-001)
+    # misses 4-6-sentence paragraphs of long sentences that render >8 mobile lines
+    # (recurring pass-5 medium in 2/2 essays; see mobile-paragraph-wall in the ledger).
+    for start, text in paragraphs:
+        n_words = len(re.findall(r"\S+", text))
+        if n_words > MAX_WORDS_PER_PARA:
+            findings.append({
+                "check_id": "STRUCT-005",
+                "severity": "warn",
+                "message": "paragraph has %d words (max %d; ~8 mobile lines at 12-14 w/line)"
+                           % (n_words, MAX_WORDS_PER_PARA),
+                "location": "line %d" % start,
+            })
```

Also update the module docstring check list:

```diff
   STRUCT-004: rule-of-three — sentences with an "A, B, and C" triad of short items.
+  STRUCT-005: a body paragraph with more than MAX_WORDS_PER_PARA words (mobile wall).
```

**File 2: `.claude/skills/_shared/scripts/test_gates.py`** — add to `TestStructure`:

```diff
     def test_bullet_overuse_warns(self):
         draft = "Intro line.\n- a\n- b\n- c\n- d\n"
         r = gate_structure.check(draft, {})
         self.assertTrue(_has(r, "STRUCT-003"))
+
+    def test_word_wall_warns_even_with_few_sentences(self):
+        # 2 sentences x 56 words = 112 words: invisible to STRUCT-001, caught by STRUCT-005.
+        para = " ".join(["word"] * 56) + ". " + " ".join(["word"] * 56) + "."
+        r = gate_structure.check(para + "\n", {})
+        self.assertTrue(r["passed"])  # warn only, never a hard fail
+        self.assertTrue(_has(r, "STRUCT-005"))
+        self.assertFalse(_has(r, "STRUCT-001"))
+
+    def test_normal_paragraph_no_word_wall_warning(self):
+        r = gate_structure.check("Short paragraph. Two sentences only.\n", {})
+        self.assertFalse(_has(r, "STRUCT-005"))
```

**File 3: `.claude/skills/_shared/references/scoring-rubric.md`** — keep the gate table in
sync (one cell):

```diff
-| `structure`  | (none — all warn) | `STRUCT-001..004` | 3, 4a |
+| `structure`  | (none — all warn) | `STRUCT-001..005` | 3, 4a |
```

## Why this lever

- The defect is purely mechanical (word arithmetic) and the editor has now performed the
  identical arithmetic by hand in four review rounds; that is exactly what gate promotion is
  for. The run-1 editorial recommendation named this promotion verbatim.
- Zero false-positive *blast radius*: `gate_structure` is warn-only by design, so STRUCT-005
  can never fail a round; it feeds pass-5 exactly where the manual arithmetic feeds today.
  Note: run 2's accepted final retains three adjudicated 96–114w paragraphs; STRUCT-005
  would warn on the two >110w ones — that is intended behavior (warn → pass-5 adjudication,
  which already recorded those stands as accepted).
- A companion `reference-edit` (a paragraph word band in `section-blueprint.md`, jointly
  specified with the deliverable-voice 3–7-sentence band) is deliberately NOT bundled here
  (one lever per proposal); it is the natural follow-up if `revision-induced-band-break`
  (currently 2 records, 2/2 essays) reaches the bar — splits that satisfy the mobile ceiling
  by breaking the sentence band.

## Regression expectation

- `python .claude/skills/_shared/scripts/test_gates.py`: all existing tests pass unchanged
  (STRUCT-005 is additive, warn-only) + the 2 new cases pass.
- `python meta/regression.py`: `clean-baseline` fixture must still report `gate_pass: true`
  with **no STRUCT-005 finding** (its paragraphs are short — verify; if any fixture
  paragraph exceeds 110 words the fixture's `must_not_contain_check_ids` should not list
  STRUCT-005 since warns don't affect `gate_pass`); `figure-orphan` fixture must still fail
  on `FIGUSE-001` only.
- Success criterion for the next run: zero pass-5 `medium` wall findings; walls surface as
  STRUCT-005 warns at compose time instead of costing an editorial round.
