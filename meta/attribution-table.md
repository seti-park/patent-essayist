# Attribution table — finding class → goal + owner stage/artifact + lever

The meta-loop's brain. `pipeline-retro` reads this to route each normalized finding to the
*stage and artifact that should have prevented it*, tag it with the north-star goal it
threatens, and pick the default improvement lever. Human-editable: when a new finding class
appears that isn't covered, add a row (that itself is a small reference-edit proposal).

Voice fencing is encoded here on purpose: Phase-3 voice findings route to
`anti-ai-writing.md` / `deliverable-voice-rules.md` or a Phase-2 voice-canon admission — never
to re-exposing `voice-profile.md` in Phase 3.

## Recurrence ledger summary (auto-maintained by pipeline-retro)

`pipeline-retro` keeps a running count per class here so a human can see system health at a
glance. Counts are derived from `meta/findings-ledger.jsonl`; do not hand-edit the counts.

Counts derived from the ledger as of run `2026-06-11-us20260158546a1-both-and-steel` (second
recorded run; cross-run recurrence is now measurable). A class with a proposal on file shows
all its records under `proposed` (the proposal file under `meta/improvement-proposals/` lists
the triggering finding ids and is the append-only audit reference).

Cross-essay recurrence (present in 2/2 essays): `claim-scope-misattribution` (HIGH +
grounding hard-gate breach both runs — most damaging class in the system),
`mobile-paragraph-wall` (medium walls both runs, gate-invisible to sentence-counting
STRUCT-001), `external-fact-universalization`, `fence-canon-verification-gap` (escalated
low → medium; run-2 resolution field-tested the interrogative-🤔-host fix),
`redundancy-bloat`, `revision-induced-band-break`, `paraphrase-hedge-compression`, and
`figure-token-regex-blindspot` (latent; avoided by trap-3 convention both runs — counted as
recurring mitigation cost, not failure).

RECUR_THRESHOLD=3 reached by record count: `external-fact-universalization`,
`fence-canon-verification-gap`, `mobile-paragraph-wall` (proposals on file,
recommended-apply) and `redundancy-bloat` (deliberately HELD at `watch`: all five records
low-severity, heterogeneous sub-mechanisms — anchor doubling, caption echo, layering
awareness, two intensifier tics — no single mechanical rule covers them and the class has
never cost a loop iteration). 5 proposals on file as of 2026-06-11; see
`meta/improvement-proposals/2026-06-11-*.md`. Do not hand-edit the counts.
† = new finding class with no row in the main table above; adding the missing rows is itself
a small reference-edit proposal per this table's header (human decision, still pending from
run 1).
