# Attribution table — finding class → goal + owner stage/artifact + lever

The meta-loop's brain. `pipeline-retro` reads this to route each normalized finding to the
*stage and artifact that should have prevented it*, tag it with the north-star goal it
threatens, and pick the default improvement lever. Human-editable: when a new finding class
appears that isn't covered, add a row (that itself is a small reference-edit proposal).

Voice fencing is encoded here on purpose: Phase-3 voice findings route to
`anti-ai-writing.md` / `deliverable-voice-rules.md` or a Phase-2 voice-canon admission — never
to re-exposing `voice-profile.md` in Phase 3.

## Recurrence ledger summary (auto-maintained by pipeline-retro)

`pipeline-retro` keeps a running count per class here so a human can see system health at a
glance. Counts are derived from `meta/findings-ledger.jsonl`; do not hand-edit the counts.

| pattern_tag | open | watch | proposed | resolved | escalated | patches applied |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| claim-accuracy-paraphrase | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| redundancy-bloat | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| spec-undercoverage | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

Class-level signals (across essays):
- **claim-accuracy-paraphrase** — 2 instances in essay 045 (both pass-3, compose). Within-essay
  cluster, below the cross-essay recurrence threshold (3). Status: **watch** — if a 2nd essay
  shows the same class, promote a `reference-edit` proposal tightening
  `essay-en-composer/references/citation-format.md` (explicit "verify the source's stated
  hierarchy/scope before paraphrasing a quantitative or ordering claim").
- **spec-undercoverage** — 1 low instance (optional, non-spine). Watch.

Applied out-of-band during run 045 (gate-promotion lever, human-applied with tests, not via a
ledger proposal — recorded here for the audit trail):
- `gate_figure_use` + `gate_anchors`: sub-figure letter tokens (1A/1B/5B) — real patents use
  them; commit 5c2249a / fed6acf.
- `gate_figure_use`: scope the selected set to the "## Selected figures" section + strip HTML
  comments (a real figure-selection.md discusses dropped figures) — commit 5c2249a.
