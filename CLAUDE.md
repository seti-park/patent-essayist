# Patent Essay System (Claude Code / web)

A skill-based pipeline that turns an **English patent** (+ figures, raw or cleaned) into a
finished **English essay** for X Articles, written for a **curious retail investor** (technical
comprehension between advanced high school and early undergraduate — see
`_shared/references/reader-profile.md`). Four phases — **Figures → Design → Compose → Edit** —
pass data through on-disk hand-off directories. Every phase runs in an **isolated agent
context** (`context: fork` + `.claude/agents/`), and an orchestrator runs the Compose↔Edit
quality loop to a **double-clean acceptance** verified by a mechanical run-completeness check.
After each essay a slower **meta-loop** (`pipeline-retro`) proposes improvements to the system
itself.

## North-star goals (acceptance criteria)

Every gate and editorial pass defends one of four goals; the full goal→check traceability
matrix is in `_shared/references/scoring-rubric.md`:

1. **Catch the patent's core accurately** — anchor chain + verbatim-quote gate, grounding.
2. **Use figures + specification sufficiently** — `gate_figure_use` + pass-3 coverage.
3. **Easy for the reader to understand** — reader-profile calibration, structure, pass-5/7.
4. **Well-structured (4a) and natural (4b)** — incl. the **verdict hard-gate**: conclusions
   must be evidence-proportionate in BOTH directions (no overreach, no safe-harbor hedging).

## How to run

```
/patent-essay <patent path | text | number>  [--threshold pass|revise-recommended] [--max-iter 4] [--mode essay|wire] [--self-audit on|off]
```

Inputs live under `input/`: `patent.md`, `figures/fig-NN.png` (cleaned) **or**
`figures-raw/` (zip / TIFF drop — Phase 0 cleans it), and optional `essay-context.md`
(per-run audience/edition overrides). The orchestrator runs Phase 0-3 plus the loop, the
post-acceptance self-audit, `check_run.py`, archives to `runs/<essay-id>/`, runs the
meta-loop, and returns the final essay + score history + check_run verdict.

**Model allocation** (the recommended setup): run the SESSION on the strongest model
available (Fable 5) — the main thread holds loop policy, arbitration, and acceptance calls,
and `model: inherit` agents (design / compose / review / self-audit readers) get that model
in clean contexts, which is where writing and editorial judgment quality comes from.
Mechanical agents pin cheaper models in their frontmatter (`grounding-verifier`,
`figures-prep`: `model: sonnet`). An "advisor" pattern (weak main model consulting a strong
one) is deliberately NOT used: prose and integration quality are bounded by the model that
holds the pen, not the one giving advice.

Individual phases can be run standalone: `/patent-figures-clean`, `/thesis-architect`,
`/essay-en-composer`, `/editorial-review`, `/pipeline-retro` (`/voice-canon-lookup` is an
internal Phase-2 helper).

Data flows by **output contracts**: each phase's `SKILL.md` defines the exact files it writes
to `handoff/<phase>/`, and the next phase reads them — no chat copy-paste, no shared
conversation state. Context isolation is enforced by the harness (forked agents), not by
instructions: the reviewer physically cannot see the composer's reasoning, only its artifacts.

## Voice + source fencing (by agent, physical)

- **Design (voice-off, design-architect):** thesis-architect references only — no voice canon.
- **Compose (voice-on, essay-composer):** full voice stack + reader-profile; NEVER reads the
  raw patent (Quotable spans are the only patent source).
- **Edit (voice-fenced, editorial-reviewer):** `deliverable-voice-rules` + `anti-ai-writing`
  + `reader-profile` only — not voice-profile / caption-roles. Fresh instance per round.
- **Self-audit (adversarial-reader / grounding-verifier):** blind to each other; can only ADD
  findings; grounding recommendations are anchor/narrow/label/cut — never "add a hedge".

## Loop control (three tiers)

- **Inner loop (auto):** per round — gates (`run_gates.py`, now incl. `gate_quotes`
  invention-summary↔patent verbatim and `gate_hedge` verdict over-hedge) + a FRESH
  `editorial-review` (severity model, finding_ids). **Acceptance = double-clean**: two
  consecutive clean rounds from independent reviewers (a round-1 "pass" is a hypothesis, not
  a verdict). On FAIL: `essay-en-composer` revision mode — every medium+ finding gets an
  `applied`/`rejected` disposition in `revision-response.round-N.md` (revision-mode.md), and
  the next reviewer verifies each disposition landed. Hard-gates: grounding (pass-3
  high/critical, gate_anchors, gate_quotes), goal-2 (FIGUSE-001, coverage), **verdict**
  (gate_hedge fail / 6G high under firm closing). Max 4 revision rounds; at cap, ship the
  best round ONLY with an explicit `CAP HIT` in score-history + surfaced findings.
- **Run-completeness (auto):** `_shared/scripts/check_run.py` must pass before archiving —
  it mechanically proves the loop ran (contiguous round artifacts, disposition coverage, no
  dropped finding_ids, double-clean or CAP HIT, self-audit evidence). If it fails, do the
  missing work; never edit artifacts to satisfy it.
- **Self-audit (auto, post-acceptance):** ≥2 `adversarial-reader` agents (personas, blind,
  parallel) + 1 `grounding-verifier`; multi-vote; over-hedge findings are first-class
  (symmetric with overreach); fixes via composer revision mode; `## delta` blocks in
  revision-notes.md; loop until dry (cap 3); normalized to the ledger as
  `origin: self-post-accept`.
- **Meta-loop (`pipeline-retro`, propose-only):** normalizes inner-loop + self-audit +
  human-post-accept findings into `meta/findings-ledger.jsonl` (attribution-table keys),
  writes evidence-backed proposals. It never edits a skill — a human applies after
  `meta/regression.py` passes.

## Deterministic gates

`_shared/scripts/run_gates.py` runs thirteen mechanical checks (pass `--patent` for the
quote gate): `gate_emdash`, `gate_anchors` (incl. panel-letter figure tokens), **`gate_quotes`**
(every invention-summary Quotable span / Quote anchor row verbatim-present in patent.md — the
mechanical half of the grounding chain), `gate_sources`, `gate_banned`, `gate_structure`
(STRUCT-001 warns at ≥8 sentences, aligned to Pass 2C), `gate_figure_use`, `gate_meta`,
`gate_stub`, `gate_cashtag`, `gate_dupe`, `gate_typography`, and **`gate_hedge`** (verdict-section
safe-harbor boilerplate / qualifier-led verdict / hedge density; hard-fails under the draft's
`closing_posture: firm`). Utilities: `strip_publication.py` (publication.md with one line per
paragraph) and `check_run.py` (loop shape). Run
`python .claude/skills/_shared/scripts/test_gates.py` for the suite, or
`python meta/regression.py` for tests + fixtures.

## The over-hedge defense (why conclusions stay firm)

The historical failure: passes 3/4 punished overreach, nothing punished over-hedge, and the
cheapest way to satisfy a grounding critic is to hedge — so conclusions ratcheted toward
"a patent doesn't guarantee production/stock gains" boilerplate. The defense is now
structural, at four layers: (1) `thesis-spine.md` declares `closing_posture: firm` by default
for verdict editions; (2) the composer's closing directive drafts the call first with ONE
patent-specific anti-hype guard; (3) editorial 6G + the jurisdiction fence (grounding passes
may never recommend hedging; fix priority = anchor → narrow → label → cut); (4) `gate_hedge`
hard-fails boilerplate/qualifier-led verdicts under a firm posture. The steelman must be a
THIS-patent objection — generic patent truisms are banned as steelmen and count as
`steelman-absent`.

## Customization

- **Audience** in `_shared/references/reader-profile.md` (per-run override via
  `input/essay-context.md`); **behavior** in `_shared/references/` (scoring-rubric,
  anti-ai-writing, deliverable-voice-rules) and each skill's `references/`; the banned-term
  list is mirrored to `_shared/scripts/banned_terms.txt`. The composition/hygiene canon is
  govuk-based plain English with patent-domain exceptions (claim language, terms of art, part
  numbers, verbatim quotes keep exact wording).
- **Grow the canon** via `pipeline-retro` proposals, applied by a human after
  `meta/regression.py`.
- **Originals** in `docs/source-prompts/` (incl. Phase-4 `promo-composer`, preserved for a
  future port). Keep each phase's output contract intact when porting.
