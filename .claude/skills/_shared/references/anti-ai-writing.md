# Anti-AI-Writing canon (Phase 2 strip, Phase 3 Pass 1 check)

SETI's anti-AI-tell rules are the source of truth for naturalness (north-star goal 4b). This
canon has two tiers:

- **Mechanical subset** — the unambiguous banned words/patterns, mirrored to
  `_shared/scripts/banned_terms.txt` and hard-enforced by `gate_banned.py` (and the
  reader-instruction / essay-self-reference patterns by `gate_meta.py`). A hit fails the
  loop round.
- **Judgment list** — the richer set of AI tells (copula avoidance, transition fingerprint,
  hedging, scaffolding, etc.) that editorial **Pass 1** evaluates with context. These are not
  mechanically gated because flagging them blindly would false-fail legitimate prose.

The two well-researched vendored skills (`_shared/vendor/humanizer`, `_shared/vendor/ai-check`)
have been **absorbed into this canon** and are kept only as reference (they are NOT run in the
runtime loop — a generic detector would fight SETI's voice). The meta-loop (`pipeline-retro`)
grows this canon over time and proposes promotions into the mechanical subset when a pattern
recurs and is safe to enforce.

## Tier 1 — Mechanical banned list (mirrored to banned_terms.txt)

### Banned words (Pass 1 — high severity, hard gate)

```
delve, tapestry, vibrant, pivotal, crucial, fostering, underscore, meticulous,
intricate, testament, garner, bolstered, showcase, enhance, enduring, valuable,
boasts, renowned, multifaceted, leverage, navigate, resonate, nestled,
groundbreaking, interplay
```

Context-dependent (canon-banned, but left to judgment to avoid false fails):
- **landscape** — banned in the abstract sense ("competitive landscape"); fine geographically.
- **Additionally** — banned sentence-initial only (the gate regex catches the sentence-initial form).

### Banned rhetorical patterns (Pass 1 — high severity)

- **not-just-X-but-Y / not-only-but** negative parallelism. *(gated)*
- **despite-the-challenges** throat-clearing introductions. *(gated)*
- **copula avoidance** — "serves as a / stands as a / represents a / constitutes" in place of
  is/are. *(serves/stands-as-a gated; the rest judged)*
- **section summaries / generic conclusions** — "In summary", "To recap", "In conclusion". *(gated)*
- **filler announcement** — "It's worth noting that…". *(gated)*
- **reader-instruction / essay-self-reference** — telling the reader how to read ("read it
  the way an examiner would", "watch how X handles each", "notice how") or naming the essay as
  an object ("everything below is…", "the rest of this essay", "in this essay we", "this essay
  will show"). The reader buys insight, not stage directions. *(gated by `gate_meta.py`
  `META-001`; softer reader-address → `META-002` / judgment. Functional scope disclaimers like
  "this essay does not adjudicate X" are deliberately NOT flagged.)*
- **vague attributions** — "Many experts believe", "It is widely accepted", "Studies show".
- **puffery** — "remarkable", "extraordinary", "unprecedented".
- **elegant variation** — the same subject renamed mid-paragraph (Tesla → the EV maker → the
  Austin-based company).

## Tier 2 — Judgment list (Pass 1, absorbed from vendored research)

### AI vocabulary co-occurrence (humanizer §7)

Beyond the banned words above, watch for clustering of: *actually, align with, emphasizing,
highlight (verb), key (adjective), unlock, foster, seamless, robust, realm, game-changer.*
A single use may be fine; a cluster is an AI tell.

### Transition-word fingerprint (ai-check Signal F)

Strong tells as paragraph openers: **Furthermore, Moreover, Additionally** (sentence-initial),
"It is clear that", "This highlights/underscores the importance of", "As previously mentioned",
"Needless to say". Moderate: "Turns out / it turns out that" as a manufactured-discovery pivot;
tutorial-voice transitions ("The standard fix is…", "The common approach is…");
announcement-colon patterns ("The key insight:", "What surprised me was…").

### Structural / punctuation tells (humanizer §§14–19, ai-check Signal G)

- **Em dashes** — cut them (also `gate_emdash`). Double em-dash wrapping and em-dash-as-pivot
  are near-certain AI tells.
- **Semicolons** joining two independent clauses in non-academic prose.
- **Mid-sentence colons** after an incomplete clause ("The problem: nobody tests this").
- **Boldface overuse** (also `STRUCT-002`); **inline-header vertical lists**; **emoji** (only 🤔
  at a `closing-open-question` ending). (Body-heading capitalization is **Title Case** by house
  style — see `deliverable-voice-rules.md` — so it is not a tell here.)

### Content-shape tells (humanizer §§1–6, 25)

- Undue emphasis on significance / legacy / "broader trends".
- "-ing"-ending superficial analyses ("highlighting the importance of…").
- Promotional / advertisement language; "challenges and future prospects" outline sections.
- Generic positive conclusions ("a bright future", "continues to evolve").

### Hedging & filler (humanizer §§23–24, ai-check Signal C)

- Filler phrases ("in order to" → "to", "due to the fact that" → "because", "at this point in
  time" → "now", "has the ability to" → "can").
- Stacked hedges ("could potentially possibly").

### Plain-English word swaps (GOV.UK base)

The composition-hygiene canon is based on the govuk-style plain-English standard. Prefer the
plain word: **use** not utilise, **help** not facilitate, **start** not commence, **end** not
terminate, **about** not in relation to, **so** not in order to, **enough** not sufficient. The
unambiguous, sense-independent tells (`utilise`, `utilize`, `facilitate`, `commence`,
`deep dive`, `going forward`, `ring-fence`) are mirrored to `scripts/banned_terms.txt` and
hard-gated by `gate_banned`. The sense-dependent swaps stay here as Pass-1 judgment so a
legitimate technical use ("terminate" a connection, "sufficient" voltage) is not false-failed.

## What NOT to flag (false-positive guard)

Preserve genuine human writing: domain terms used precisely, deliberate repetition for
emphasis, one well-placed em-dash inside a verbatim patent quote (allowed by `gate_emdash`),
intentional sentence fragments for cadence that match the voice canon. The judgment list is for
*clusters and patterns*, not isolated single words in otherwise human prose.

## The strip pipeline (Phase 2 step 7)

1. Draft in voice (Phase 2, full voice stack on).
2. Strip residual AI tells per this canon → clean `publication.md` (see
   `essay-en-composer/references/strip-pipeline.md`).
3. `gate_banned.py` is the mechanical backstop; editorial Pass 1 is the judgment backstop;
   this canon is the intent both enforce.

## Keeping script + canon in sync

When the Tier-1 list changes, update `_shared/scripts/banned_terms.txt` (literals one per
line; `re:` prefix for regex) so `gate_banned.py` stays aligned. `pipeline-retro` proposes
these edits with evidence; a human applies them after the regression check.
