# Mode specification

Referenced by tech-essay-en SKILL.md Step 0 and Step 4. Defines the two-dimensional mode space, default behavior, mid-pipeline shifts, and per-mode composition rhythm.

## Two dimensions

tech-essay-en operates along two orthogonal dimensions, both selectable at invocation.

### Dimension 1: Mode category

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **walkthrough** (default) | Section-by-section composition. SETI mid-session editorial intervention welcome. Catches at sentence or section level for voice, clarity, thesis alignment, audience perception. |
| **strict-execution** | Pure prose expansion from Blueprint. No mid-session intervention. Plan ⊥ Execute strict reading. |
| **pair** | Interactive at each sentence. SETI plus Claude step-by-step dialogue. |
| **investor** | Accessible altitude. Stake-first; mechanism compressed to ~1 paragraph; so-what elevated. Body under ~1100 words; no inline `[xxxx]` or reference numbers in the body; plain-language figure captions. Keeps subheadings + `# Sources` block. Default posture: measured. |

### Dimension 2: Posture (mode spectrum)

| Posture | Behavior |
|---|---|
| **aggressive** | Thesis-altering catches welcome. Framing changes possible. Voice bold experimentation. |
| **measured** (default) | Voice and clarity polish plus minor thesis adjustment. Major framing preserved. |
| **conservative** | Voice and clarity polish only. Thesis plus framing preserved. Factual accuracy emphasized. |

### Default combination

When mode is not specified at invocation: **walkthrough + measured**.

## Step 0 selection logic

- Invocation specifies mode and posture → adopt both
- Invocation specifies only mode → adopt mode and apply default posture (measured)
- Invocation specifies neither → adopt walkthrough plus measured
- If `audience=investor` → adopt the accessible blueprint variant + word ceiling (see `references/section-blueprint.md`); patent anchors are recorded in `thesis-trace.md`, not surfaced in the body.

Confirm mode and posture in the opening response before Step 1.

Example opening:

> "Beginning tech-essay-en in walkthrough mode plus measured posture. Section-by-section composition; please catch any voice, clarity, or thesis concerns mid-session."

## Step 4 composition rhythm per mode

Per-mode composition behavior during Step 4 of the SKILL.md process:

- **walkthrough**: compose section → present → SETI elicit catch → refine if catch → next section. Each section is a checkpoint.
- **strict-execution**: compose all sections → emit full draft → no mid-session checkpoint.
- **pair**: compose sentence → SETI elicit → refine → next sentence. Sentence-level checkpoint.

## Catch scope by posture (walkthrough only)

Mid-session catches in walkthrough mode have posture-bounded scope.

**Measured (default) catches bounded to:**

- Voice and clarity polish (voice canon compliance)
- Sentence-level refinement
- Section transition adjustments
- Minor thesis hint refinement (within blueprint thesis)

**Always out of catch scope** (require blueprint revision, return to essay-architect):

- Fact introduction (new facts beyond `facts_locked`)
- Structural deviation (section reorder, add, remove)
- Major thesis change (blueprint `thesis_statement` modification)

Aggressive posture extends the bounded scope to allow framing variation. Conservative posture narrows the bounded scope to voice and clarity polish only.

## Mid-pipeline mode shift

SETI may explicitly shift mode mid-essay. The nature of an emerging catch may also trigger an implicit shift suggestion:

- Thesis-altering catch in measured-posture walkthrough → propose aggressive shift
- Thesis-altering catch in conservative-posture walkthrough → propose either upgrade to measured or aggressive, or return to essay-architect for blueprint revision
- Strict-execution session reveals blueprint coverage incomplete → propose shift to walkthrough or return for blueprint revision

Surface the shift proposal explicitly. SETI decides: shift, abandon attempt, or return to essay-architect.
