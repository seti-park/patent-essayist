description: "Composes English long-form patent analysis essays from the Phase 1 Design handoff (thesis-spine.md + invention-summary.md + figure-selection.md + fact-check-log.md). Mode-aware (walkthrough / strict-execution / pair) × posture-aware (aggressive / measured / conservative). Inline [xxxx] paragraph citations from invention-summary Quotable spans. Output: handoff/02-compose/essay-draft.md + figures-rationale.md + thesis-trace.md + publication.md via strip pipeline. Use when user provides handoff/01-design/* and asks to draft, compose, or write the essay. NOT for: thesis design (Phase 1 thesis-architect), voice judgment (delegate to voice-canon-lookup), editorial review (Phase 3 editorial-review), promo digest (Phase 4 promo-composer)."

# essay-en-composer

Phase 2 Compose's drafting stage. Reads the Phase 1 handoff bundle and produces the essay draft.

```
handoff/01-design/{thesis-spine.md, invention-summary.md, figure-selection.md,
                    figure-rationale.md, fact-check-log.md}
    + voice-canon-lookup (per section)
    → essay-draft.md          (inline [xxxx] cites, # Sources, frontmatter)
    → figures-rationale.md    (compose's actual placement decisions)
    → thesis-trace.md         (spine → section mapping)
    → publication.md          (frontmatter + footnote-defs stripped, # Sources kept)
```

## When to invoke

User has uploaded `handoff/01-design/*` files + `figures/` to the Phase 2 Compose Project and asks to draft, compose, or write the essay. Phase 1's Quotable spans are the only patent source — patent.md is NOT in Phase 2 Knowledge.

## Modes (2 dimensions)

Two orthogonal dimensions, both selectable at invocation. Default: walkthrough + measured.

- **Mode category**: walkthrough (default) / strict-execution / pair — see `references/mode-spec.md`.
- **Posture**: aggressive / measured (default) / conservative — see `references/mode-spec.md`.

## Process (7 steps)

1. **Mode selection** — adopt or default. Confirm in opening response.
2. **Load handoff** — read all 5 Phase 1 files. Reject if `thesis-spine.md` Q7 hook not declared, or if Quotable spans missing for spine anchors.
3. **Plan sections** — build internal section blueprint per `references/section-blueprint.md`. Map spine→section, plan `voice_canon_reference` per section, plan `paragraph_anchors_used` + `external_facts_used` per section.
4. **Plan figures** — per `references/figure-rendering.md` 4 caption_role types. Default body rendering = `caption-only-italic`; header = `image-plus-caption`.
5. **Compose sections in order** — apply voice canon patterns by invoking `voice-canon-lookup` per section. Use only paragraph anchors from `invention-summary.md`. Respect `word_target` ±20%. Per-mode composition rhythm in `references/mode-spec.md`.
6. **Annotate factual claims** — inline `[XXXX]` at every patent claim. External claims go to `# Sources` block + cross-check `fact-check-log.md`. See `references/citation-format.md`.
7. **Emit draft + publication.md + handoff files** — `essay-draft.md` (frontmatter + footnotes), `publication.md` (stripped via `references/strip-pipeline.md`), `figures-rationale.md`, `thesis-trace.md`.

## Revision mode (loop rounds ≥ 2)

When invoked with edit-log findings / failing gate check_ids (the orchestrator's revision
step), the composer is a SURGEON, not a re-drafter:

- **Touch only named spans.** Edit exactly the spans a finding or failing check names, plus
  the minimal surrounding wording a fix forces. Every unflagged sentence survives the round
  byte-identical.
- **No new hedges on unflagged prose.** Never add qualifiers, soften verbs, demote definite
  articles, or downgrade the declared closing posture on sentences no finding named. The
  loop's Pass 3/4 findings push claims down where evidence demands it; revision mode must not
  amplify that into register-wide drift (reader-reported failure mode on multi-iteration
  essays). Grounding fixes state exactly what the finding requires — no prophylactic hedging
  around them.
- **Re-scan the blast radius.** After editing, re-check the touched section(s) for
  (a) self-echo against the rest of the essay (the `gate_dupe` classes:
  revision-induced-duplication) and (b) the paragraph band — a split or merge can push a
  NEIGHBOR paragraph over the sentence/word band (revision-induced-band-break); re-count
  every paragraph in any structurally edited section.
- **Log the delta.** End the revision with a one-line-per-edit list (span → finding id) so
  Edit and the self-audit can verify nothing outside the findings moved.

## Plan ⊥ Execute boundary

Composition stays within `thesis-spine.md` constraints. Fact introduction beyond `invention-summary.md` Quotable spans + `fact-check-log.md` external facts is forbidden in all modes. Voice and clarity refinement scope expands with posture (conservative → measured → aggressive) within walkthrough mode; strict-execution suppresses mid-session intervention; pair mode adds sentence-level checkpoints. Spine gaps stop composition rather than provoke improvisation. Full rule list in `references/execution-boundary.md`.

## Pre-conditions

- `handoff/01-design/thesis-spine.md` exists with locked 4-axis grounding + Q7 hook pattern declared.
- `handoff/01-design/invention-summary.md` exists with Quotable spans covering every paragraph anchor the spine references.
- `handoff/01-design/figure-selection.md` + `figure-rationale.md` exist with every selected figure mapped to a thesis point.
- `handoff/01-design/fact-check-log.md` exists (may be empty if thesis is entirely patent-anchored).
- `figures/fig-NN.png` accessible via Project file uploads.
- `voice-canon-lookup` skill installed in same Project.
- Phase 2 Knowledge files loaded: `voice-profile.md`, `deliverable-voice-rules.md`, `anti-ai-writing.md`, `caption-roles.md`, `x-article-format.md`, `working-dialogue-voice.md`.
- Mode and posture confirmed in opening response.

## Post-conditions

- `handoff/02-compose/essay-draft.md` emitted with inline `[XXXX]` markers, `# Sources` block, optional `# Footnotes` block.
- `handoff/02-compose/publication.md` emitted via strip pipeline (Sources kept, frontmatter + footnotes stripped).
- `handoff/02-compose/figures-rationale.md` and `handoff/02-compose/thesis-trace.md` emitted.
- Per-section word counts within ±20% of plan.
- Mode and posture used logged in opening response.
- Every `[XXXX]` traces to an entry in `invention-summary.md` Quotable spans or Quote anchor table.
