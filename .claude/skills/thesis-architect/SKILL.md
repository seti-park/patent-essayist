# thesis-architect

Phase 1 Design's primary inferential stage. Reads a patent + cleaned figures and produces the `handoff/01-design/` bundle that Phase 2 Compose executes against.

```
patent.md + figures/ + context research
    → invention-summary.md   (structured patent analysis with Quotable spans)
    → thesis candidates (2-4) → 4-axis grounding → Q7 hook gate → adversarial defense
    → thesis-spine.md         (locked single-spine + 4-axis anchors + Q7 + defense)
    → figure-selection.md     (figure ↔ thesis-point mapping)
    → figure-rationale.md     (per-figure purpose + intended effect)
    → fact-check-log.md       (external-fact seed)
```

## When to invoke

User supplies `patent.md` and a cleaned `figures/` directory (output of Layer 1 `patent-figures-clean`) and asks for thesis design, invention analysis, essay outline planning, or Phase 1 Design output. Entry point for Phase 1 — no upstream skill within Phase 1.

## Audience input

The process accepts an optional `audience` input: `deep` (default — current behavior, unchanged) or `investor` (accessible altitude). Audience can flip the thesis **frame**: an `investor` spine favors a forward-capability / market-opportunity hook (e.g. "to cover the planet for mobile, you need this architecture") over a backward post-mortem hook, and declares a `reader_stake` (what the investor reader decides or gets). The 4-axis grounding rigor and single-spine default are **unchanged** by audience — only the frame and what surfaces downstream shift.

## Process

1. **Invention summary extraction** — read patent.md, write `invention-summary.md` per `references/invention-summary-schema.md`. Includes `**Quotable spans:**` `[xxxx]` blocks (verbatim, no paraphrase). Phase 2 reads these directly without re-touching patent.md.
2. **Context research** — web-search for industry baseline, corporate narratives, prior product launches. Log every query to `search-log.md`. **Each significant finding classified for framing-impact (main thread / paragraph / footnote) at discovery time** — SETI quick decision before Step 3 candidate generation. Output feeds the baseline-difference axis. See `references/context-research.md`.
3. **Thesis candidate generation** — 2-4 candidates, single-spine default. Each candidate carries draft 4-axis grounding. Write `thesis-candidates.md` capturing each candidate's frame + 4-axis status + rejection reason (for rejected ones). See `references/thesis-candidate-presentation.md`.
4. **4-axis grounding lock** — for each candidate, fill all 4 axes (claims / problem / effect / baseline-difference). Any missing axis disqualifies the candidate. See `references/4-axis-grounding.md`.
5. **Q7 hook gate (hard)** — each surviving candidate must map to exactly one of 2 admitted hook patterns. Otherwise reject. See `references/hook-patterns.md`.
6. **Adversarial defense** — surface the strongest objection per surviving candidate, draft mitigation. Context research's **layer-confusion findings** are priority inputs for Category 1 objections. See `references/adversarial-defense.md`.
7. **SETI selects one** — single-spine default; multi-spine requires explicit override per `references/single-spine-default.md`.
8. **Spine lock** — write `thesis-spine.md` with locked candidate's 4-axis anchors, Q7 pattern, adversarial defense, spine→section trace. When `audience=investor`, also declare a `reader_stake` field (what the investor reader decides or gets). For `deep` the field may be omitted.
9. **Figure mapping** — write `figure-selection.md` and `figure-rationale.md`. Each figure maps to a thesis point + caption_role. **Paired-figure relationships** (same-page / sub-figure / before-after sequence) reviewed explicitly — pull from `invention-summary.md` §"Figure relationships". **Audience-aware selection**: for `audience=investor`, select fewer figures by the test "does this help a non-expert understand" (higher-impact figures only), rather than full mechanism coverage. `deep` selection is unchanged.
10. **Fact-check log seed** — write `fact-check-log.md` listing every external (non-patent) fact the spine relies on, with source URL.
11. **Phase 2 handoff notes** — write `phase2-handoff-notes.md` capturing: (a) Phase 1 의 audience reframe 결정 (if any) (b) 인용 priority 매핑 (어느 Quotable span 이 essay 의 어느 section 에 우선 사용) (c) framing decision 의 trace (rejected candidates 의 핵심 사유) (d) Phase 2 가 우회해야 할 함정 (e) open questions for Phase 2 (SETI 결정 대기 항목).

## Pre/post conditions

Pre:
- `patent.md` uploaded to Phase 1 Project Knowledge.
- `figures/fig-NN.png` uploaded (output of Layer 1).
- Voice fencing enforced by Phase 1 PI — NO voice-profile or voice-canon access in this phase.

Post:
- `handoff/01-design/invention-summary.md` exists; every patent-text claim has a paragraph anchor; every Quotable span is verbatim.
- `handoff/01-design/thesis-spine.md` exists; selected candidate has all 4 axes anchored and Q7 hook pattern declared.
- `handoff/01-design/thesis-candidates.md` exists; all generated candidates documented (selected + rejected with rationale).
- `handoff/01-design/search-log.md` exists; every web-search query logged with URL + date + result snippet + used-in column.
- `handoff/01-design/figure-selection.md` + `figure-rationale.md` exist with every selected figure mapped to a thesis point; paired-figure relationships acknowledged.
- `handoff/01-design/fact-check-log.md` exists (may have zero entries if thesis is entirely patent-anchored).
- `handoff/01-design/phase2-handoff-notes.md` exists; Phase 2 entry instructions documented per Step 11.

## Output (short example — thesis-spine.md excerpt)

```markdown
# Thesis Spine

## Selected thesis

**One-line spine**:
> Tesla's RCM patent reveals an architectural decision made months before the public announcement that retroactively explains the 70-millisecond claim.

## 4-axis grounding

### Axis 1 — Claims anchor
> 청구항 1 의 (b) limitation — "the vision sensor providing pre-impact prediction to the airbag controller"

### Axis 2 — Problem anchor
> `[0014]` "기존 accelerometer-based systems respond after the collision begins"

### Axis 3 — Effect anchor
> `[0024]` "deployment decision is made approximately 70 milliseconds before traditional accelerometer-based systems would respond"

### Axis 4 — Baseline-difference anchor
> Bosch airbag baseline 10ms accelerometer latency vs claimed 70ms vision-path lead

## Q7 hook pattern (hard gate)
- [x] `corporate-narrative-friction` — anchor: Tesla公式발표가 patent grant 보다 11개월 후 → narrative friction

## Adversarial defense
**Strongest objection**: 70ms claim could refer to a different baseline than Bosch's 10ms accelerometer.
**Mitigation**: §3 explicitly cites both baselines and shows the comparison is apples-to-apples.
**Residual risk**: none — patent text quantitatively grounded.

## Single-spine declaration
- [x] Single-spine (default)

## Reader stake (audience = investor only)
> What the investor reader gets: a read on whether this architecture is the one a planet-scale mobile network has to adopt — i.e. the decision the patent informs.
```

The `## Reader stake` block appears only for `audience=investor` and is omitted for `deep`. The audience-reframe decision (forward-capability frame chosen over a backward post-mortem) is recorded in `phase2-handoff-notes.md` per Step 11.

Full schema → `handoff-template/01-design/thesis-spine.md`.

## Out of scope

- Prose composition — Phase 2 `essay-en-composer`.
- Voice canon work — Phase 2 `voice-canon-lookup`.
- Editorial review — Phase 3 `editorial-review`.
- Promo digest — Phase 4 `promo-composer`.
- YAML output — Phase 1 v2 emits Markdown only (handoff is human-edit-friendly).

## Feedback loop discipline

Forward-only step ordering is the default — but feedback loops are allowed when a later step surfaces a flaw in an earlier output. Examples observed in production:

- Step 2 context research finding may force re-extraction of Layer 4 innovation_angles in Step 1 invention-summary.
- Step 9 figure-mapping may force `thesis-spine.md` figure-dependence sections to update.
- Step 5 Q7 gate rejection may force return to Step 3 candidate generation.

When step N triggers a revision of step <N output, append a `> Revision note` block-quote at the end of the affected file (5-10 lines, format: `triggered by [step N] [date]: [what changed and why]`). This preserves audit trail.

If feedback loops cascade (>2 revisions of the same file), pause and ask SETI before continuing — likely a misalignment that needs explicit decision.
