# promo-composer

Phase 4 Promote. Runs POST-archive against a finished `essays/<id>/` tree and emits one
promo pack. The essay is FINAL: this skill digests it, never edits it, and its findings
never reopen the Compose↔Edit loop.

```
essays/<id>/essay-final.md                 (FINAL; frontmatter: essay_id, closing_posture)
  + publication-package/publication.md    (the paste-ready strip readers actually saw)
  + owner-briefing.md                     (Korean owner briefing; parallel archive contract,
                                           may be ABSENT on older archives)
  + handoff/02-compose/thesis-trace.md    (## Signature lines: <=3 protected exact strings)
  + README.md                             (reader_sentence)
  + publication-package/ images + posting-checklist.md   (cover + alt-text lines)
  + optional owner context               (emphasis and timing only, never new facts)
    -> essays/<id>/promo/promo-pack.md
       Verification Status header
       (a) Korean promo post, <=280자, 발행자 목소리
       (b) English promo digest, 280-340 words, FT/Economist digest genre
       (c) English 3-tweet thread sketch, each tweet <=280 chars
```

## When to invoke

After the orchestrator archives a run to `essays/<id>/` (Phase 4, on by default for essay
mode), or standalone when the user points at an archived essay and asks for promo, digest,
X post, share copy, thread, 프로모, 홍보 문구.

## vs essay-en-composer

- `essay-en-composer`: long-form ~2,000-3,500w from `handoff/01-design/`, full `[dddd]`
  citation apparatus, investor-reader altitude.
- `promo-composer`: three short deliverables from the ARCHIVE, zero new facts, zero `[dddd]`
  anchors in output, feed-reader altitude. It compresses corrected text; it performs no
  analysis of its own.

## The grounding rule (hard): the safe-claims defense

1. **Allowed factual sources**, and the only ones: `essays/<id>/essay-final.md`,
   `essays/<id>/publication-package/publication.md`, `essays/<id>/owner-briefing.md`.
   These carry the loop-corrected phrasings; treating them as the sole quarry is what keeps
   already-fixed errors dead (rationale + the scrubbed error classes:
   `references/fact-verification.md`).
2. **Every factual phrase traces** to a sentence in those sources. Numbers, dates, names,
   venue words, and verbs of certainty stay verbatim-consistent with the essay's wording
   (an application-era essay says "asks for" and "filed"; the promo never upgrades that to
   "patented" or "owns").
3. **No new factual claims. No memory-written facts. No fetching.** No web search, no
   re-reading the patent, no mining fact-check-log or other handoff internals for facts the
   essay chose not to print. If a fact you want is not in the sources, you drop it. You do
   not fetch it.
4. **The essay is FINAL.** Promo never edits any file under `essays/<id>/` except writing
   `promo/promo-pack.md`. A suspected factual defect noticed while packing goes on the
   header's `suspected_essay_defects` line for the human-post-accept channel
   (revision-notes.md); the affected claim stays OUT of the promo. Promo findings never
   reopen the loop.
5. **Owner context steers, never grounds.** Optional owner input (시의성, channel, timing)
   may adjust emphasis and posting register; a fact the owner supplies that is not in the
   sources is surfaced back as a question, not printed.

## Process

1. **Load the archive.** `essay-final.md` (frontmatter: `essay_id`, `closing_posture`,
   `draft_version`), `publication-package/publication.md`,
   `publication-package/posting-checklist.md`, `owner-briefing.md`,
   `handoff/02-compose/thesis-trace.md`, `README.md`. Reject the run if `essay-final.md` or
   `publication.md` is missing. `owner-briefing.md` absent: proceed and record `ABSENT` in
   the header; the KR post then translates from the essay's protected lines instead of
   reusing the briefing's Korean phrasings.
2. **Harvest the protected surface**: `reader_sentence` (README.md), the `## Signature
   lines` exact strings (thesis-trace.md), the title, the lead ¶1, the closing call, and
   `closing_posture`. This is the entire hook vocabulary: promo hooks compress these lines,
   they do not coin new ones.
3. **Audience adapt** per `references/audience-adaptation.md` (essay reader → X feed; KR
   post → the publisher's own Korean followers).
4. **Voice shift** per `references/voice-shift-from-essay.md`. Optional: invoke
   `voice-canon-lookup` for the `opening-news-event` and closing pattern bodies, the
   digest's only two canon touchpoints.
5. **Compose the KR post** per `references/promo-format.md` KR rules. Register per
   `_shared/references/working-dialogue-voice.md`: 건조한 평서문, 과장 배제, 발행자 1인칭
   허용. Sentence 1 lands the essay's discovery beat compressed; the last sentence points
   to the article.
6. **Compose the EN digest** per `references/promo-format.md` (title, lede, paragraph
   craft) + `references/closing-posture.md`. The digest's closing posture must agree with
   the essay's `closing_posture` (firm essay → no open-question close).
7. **Compose the thread sketch** per `references/promo-format.md` thread rules: tweet 1
   hook (reader_sentence-adjacent), tweet 2 mechanism/evidence beat, tweet 3 two-sided
   verdict + `[ARTICLE-LINK]` slot.
8. **Attachment lines** per `references/figure-attachment-policy.md`:
   `publication-package/` images only, `cover-5x2.png` default, 1-2 figures max per
   deliverable, alt text verbatim from `posting-checklist.md`.
9. **Fact-verification pass** on all three deliverables per
   `references/fact-verification.md`: per-sentence source trace + Sub-rules 1 (시점
   sequence), 2 (date arithmetic), 3 (quote anchor preservation).
10. **Hygiene self-check** (mechanical, self-run; the pack sits outside `run_gates.py`):
    - em-dash 0 and bold 0 across the whole pack; emoji <=1 total (the digest closing 🤔
      slot only, 0 is fine); hashtags 0; cashtag only if the essay itself used one.
    - banned terms 0 against `_shared/scripts/banned_terms.txt` (literal lines plus `re:`
      regexes); Tier-2 judgment tells checked per `_shared/references/anti-ai-writing.md`.
    - counts: KR post <=280자 (공백 포함, `[ARTICLE-LINK]` = 23자), digest 280-340 words
      excluding title, each tweet <=280 chars (link slot = 23).
11. **Emit** `essays/<id>/promo/promo-pack.md` (create `promo/` if needed). Every
    Verification Status line carries a measured number or PASS. Revisions overwrite in
    place with `promo_version` bumped.

## Pre-conditions

- `essays/<id>/essay-final.md` and `essays/<id>/publication-package/publication.md` exist;
  the run is accepted (double-clean or an explicit CAP HIT ship). Promo never runs on a
  mid-loop draft.
- `handoff/02-compose/thesis-trace.md` and `README.md` present in the archive.
- `essays/<id>/owner-briefing.md` expected (tracked archive deliverable per the
  owner-comprehension overhaul; contract landing in parallel). Absence is tolerated and
  recorded, not fatal.

## Post-conditions

- `essays/<id>/promo/promo-pack.md` exists: frontmatter + Verification Status header +
  three fenced paste-ready blocks + attachment metadata lines.
- All budgets met and MEASURED (자수, words, chars printed in the header).
- Every factual phrase traceable to the three sources; dropped-fact list in the header
  (usually `none`).
- Digest posture agrees with `closing_posture`.
- Everything else under `essays/<id>/` byte-identical to before the run.

=== Deliverables ===

## 1. Korean promo post (X, <=280자)

<fenced text block, paste-ready, ends with article pointer + [ARTICLE-LINK]>

- 자수: 214 (공백 포함, [ARTICLE-LINK]=23자)
- attach: publication-package/cover-5x2.png
- alt: "<cover alt, verbatim from posting-checklist.md>"

## 2. English promo digest (280-340 words)
...
## 3. Thread sketch (3 tweets)
...
```

## Out of scope

- Long-form composition (Phase 2 `essay-en-composer`); editorial review (Phase 3
  `editorial-review`); thesis design (Phase 1 `thesis-architect`).
- Korean full-article adaptation (v1 `tech-essay-ko-pub` stays dropped; the KR deliverable
  here is a <=280자 post, not an article).
- Editing anything under `essays/<id>/` except writing `promo/promo-pack.md`.
- Reopening the inner loop or the self-audit; re-running gates on the essay.
- First-instance fact verification (Phase 1 fact-check-log + Phase 3 pass 3 already did
  it; promo only reuses corrected text).

## References

  strip boundary), KR post rules, digest title/lede/paragraph craft, thread rules,
  counting methods, Final Checklist, v1→v2 deltas.

  procedure + Sub-rules 1/2/3 + posting-time cross-check + KR quote handling.
- `references/closing-posture.md`: the 4-posture taxonomy + the closing_posture agreement
  rule + Pattern-8 hedge avoidance.
- `references/audience-adaptation.md`: essay reader → X general public; expand / compress /
  drop / preserve lists; KR-post audience.
- `references/voice-shift-from-essay.md`: register shift, attribution density, markdown
  weight, KR register pointer to working-dialogue-voice.md.
- `references/figure-attachment-policy.md`: publication-package/ images, cover-5x2.png
  default, swap criteria, alt-text lines.
